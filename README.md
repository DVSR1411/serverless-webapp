This project is a simple and interactive web application that converts written text into spoken words using AWS Polly. It allows users to input text, select from a range of voice options, and hear the content spoken aloud. The frontend offers a clean interface while the backend leverages AWS’s powerful cloud-based text-to-speech capabilities.
